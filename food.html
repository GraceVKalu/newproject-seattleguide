       <p>Traveling may be one of the most complicated and stressful things to do, especially during a pandemic. 
         Another challenging thing to do when traveling is finding places to eat. With the pandemic going on it makes 
         it even harder to find places which offer a safe dine-in experience, even if you’re a local or just visiting 
         Seattle. We have created a list of restaurants that are not only delicious but offer that safe dine in experience you’re looking for.
