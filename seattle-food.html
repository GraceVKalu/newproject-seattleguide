       <p>Traveling is one of the most complicated things to do during a pandemic. 
         Making it hard to be able to enjoy your time in the city you are in. 
         To combat this we’ve created a website that gives you ideas for your trip and the 
         area as well as COVID restriction updates to each thing. 
         Our website was created for tourists, or those who are new to the Seattle area. We have several pages 
         covering topics on local Seattle teams, restaurants, activities, as well as all the new restrictions these all have with COVID.
      </p>

      <h2 class="subheader">COVID Restrictions</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>No indoor meet ups with anyone you don’t already live with. Unless you quarantine for 14 days and test negative for COVID
      </li>
      <li>Only outside socialization with people in groups of five or less</li>
      <li>Restaurants can operate at a 50% of indoor capacity as long as they only seat parties of 5 or less</li>
      <li>Retail business, including grocery store will have to limit customers to 25% of indoor capacity</li>
      <li>College and pro sports will continue as long as we put in place multiple testings</li>
    </ul>
