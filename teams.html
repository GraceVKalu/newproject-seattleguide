<li>Coronavirus has had its toll on virtually everything today, sports included. Earlier this year in march, all sporting events came to a stop/were postponed.Although changes were made, NFL teams like the Seahwaks opted to play without fans in the audience for the season. In seattle, teams have planned strategies and put together countermeasures to isolate the issue. Although most sources specualate stadiums may be able to seat limited people by december, however recent outbreaks of coronavirus can further set that back. </p>

     <h2>How the Mariners are playing in a different environment through covid/ how fan engagement works  </h2>
     <p> Covid was really hard on the MLB and there was a tense atmosphere as the team started playing again for the first time since march. Unfortunately there have also been a signnificant amount of plays and coaches who tested positive for covid. As a reult many games were postponed and teams had to reflect on their work to make sure they followed the neccessary safety protocols. Teams are also considering the fans morale and are trying to have fans tune in through video chats. They also leave cut out baords in the stands to keep players in good mind. </p>

     <h2>How the UW Huskies were affected by corona </h2>
     The UW Huskies were hit hard during the epidemic and games were canceled for the majority of the year. Its affectively been almost one year since the last UW football game played when they crushed Boise State, 38-7.

This caused a sense of detrimentation for fans and players alike. <br>
