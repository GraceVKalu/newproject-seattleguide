</center>

 	<p> There are many activites you can do in seattle during Covid. Many of them are out door activites which are safer compare to indoor. I will talk about top 5 activites to do </p>

 


<h3> 1. Pike Place Market </h3>
<img src="images/pike.jpg" alt="Seattle Background"; width="20%";height="20%">


<p> With a history going back to 1907, Pike Place Market has farmers’ stands for seasonal produce, a wealth of permanent produce stalls, four fish markets, dozens of specialty food stores for hard-to-find ingredients, a crafts market with more than 200 traders and an absurd amount of places to eat.<br>
   Because of COVID-19 general Market hours have changed. Most businesses are open from 9 a.m. - 5 p.m. Some restaurants offering takeout and delivery stay open until 8 p.m. Visit
     <a href="http://pikeplacemarket.org/blog/pick-up-meat-fish-vegetables-and-more-pike-place-market">PikePlaceMarket.org/GroceryShop</a> and <a href="http://pikeplacemarket.org/blog/pick-up-or-takeout-who-is-open-pike-place-market" target="_blank">PikePlaceMarket.org/Takeout</a> 
     for individual business hours.&nbsp; </p>
     
     
     
     
     <h3> 2. Space Needle </h3> 
     <img src="images/space.jpg" alt="Seattle Background"; width="20%";height="20%">
     <p>When it went up in 1962 it was the tallest building west of the Mississippi, standing at 158 meters (184 with spire). You’ll ascend the tower in a glass elevator to the observation deck at 160 meters, where you can ponder the Seattle’s towers, Mount Rainier, the islands on Puget Sound, the Cascade Mountains and the Olympic Mountains.<br>
      The Space Needle has reopened to visitors and has been outfitted with new tech in an attempt to make the visit as safe as possible. One of the biggest innovations: organizers say they've been able to sanitize the air itself using two types of ultraviolet lights. Using UV-C and Far-UV-C lights, both of which have been proven effective at stopping viruses in the air, they're set up four new systems to scour the building's interior of any possible disease vectors.
